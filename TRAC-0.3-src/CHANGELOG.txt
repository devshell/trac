	v0.3
- Trac now shows colour in console, allows for more than
seven columns to be used in the csv file, and it also
has a note on how to exit the program.

Source code has been commented in the trac.cpp file to make
it easier to modify and contribute to this project.

------------------------------------------------------------
	v0.2 - BETA

- TRAC now uses the row titles as the names to compare to
the .layout file data. This allows the printing of any
data configured in any way. My goal was to limit the amount
of different files to configure while maximize the amount
of things that can be done.


------------------------------------------------------------
	v0.1 - ALPHA

- First release, this program allows the filling out of a
report through taking data from an excel file and fills out
a .print file using the layout from the .layout file.

The initial purpose of this app is to fill-out 20,000
tax reciepts using an excel table of data.
